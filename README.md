CTA-Data-Visualization
======================
For this example to work, you will need to have Bottle (http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html)
and Peewee (https://github.com/coleifer/peewee) installed. I suggest using a virtualenv and 
running 'pip install bottle peewee'

You will also have to create a mysql user 'ctauser' and a mysql database 'cta', with 'ctauser' granted all permissions to 'cta'
